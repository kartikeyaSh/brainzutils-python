## Release process

For this project we are using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). If
you want to make a new release:

1. Create a new tag in git using the following format: `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`.
2. Create a release on GitHub based on that tag. Specify changes that were made.

When updating underlying dependencies keep in mind breaking changes that they
might have. Update version of `brainzutils-python` accordingly.
